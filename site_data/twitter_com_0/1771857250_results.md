FAIL — the provided HTML snapshots do not contain enough evidence to list the **ten** most recent notifications.

What’s missing: the notifications timeline in `page_4.html` is truncated mid-list, so only the first **nine** notifications are fully visible. The 10th most recent notification is not present in the supplied snapshots.

The nine most recent notifications that *are* visible (most recent first):
