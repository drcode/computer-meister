FAIL — The provided snapshots only show X’s sign-in/join pages (“Sign in to X”, “Happening now”, “Join today”) and do not include any notifications page or any notification items. To list the most recent notifications, a snapshot of the notifications feed (showing the notification entries and their timestamps/order) is missing.
