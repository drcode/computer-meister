The evidence is insufficient to answer the question.

FAIL: The snapshots show a current temperature of **9°** at **11:38 PST** on a page titled for **Mill Valley, California, Estados Unidos** (page_5.html), but the **location name/header (h1) is blank**, so the snapshot does not explicitly confirm that the **9°** reading is for **Mill Valley, CA**.
