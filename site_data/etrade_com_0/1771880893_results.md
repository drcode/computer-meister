FAIL — The provided HTML snapshots (page_3.html, page_4.html, page_5.html) only show the E*TRADE “Complete View” site header/navigation and do not include any portfolio/positions table, account name list, holdings (symbols/quantities), or any cash balance figure. “Conrad” does not appear in the provided content, and no “primary account” with holdings/cash is visible either.

Missing evidence needed:
- A section showing the **Conrad** portfolio (or any account) **positions/holdings** with **symbol and quantity**
- A section showing the **cash balance** for that portfolio/account
- The **account/portfolio name** list or selector that includes “Conrad” (or indicates the primary account)
