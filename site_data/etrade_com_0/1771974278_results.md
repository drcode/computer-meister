FAIL — The provided snapshots only show public E*TRADE pages (account marketing pages and the log-on screen). They do **not** include any authenticated “Conrad” portfolio/positions page or any account balances page.

What’s missing to answer:
- A snapshot of the **“Conrad” portfolio positions/holdings** list (stock symbols/names, share counts, etc.).
- A snapshot showing the account’s **cash balance or margin balance** (e.g., “Cash available,” “Cash balance,” “Margin balance,” or similar) for that same account/portfolio.
