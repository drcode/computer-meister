FAIL — The provided snapshots do not contain any information about a “Conrad” portfolio’s positions or its cash/margin balance.

What’s missing from the evidence:
- A portfolio/positions page (or account holdings table) showing the **Conrad** portfolio’s **stock symbols and quantities**.
- An account summary/portfolio page showing the **cash balance or margin balance** for the Conrad account/portfolio.

The snapshots provided are public E*TRADE marketing pages (“Our Accounts”) and a “Log on” page, none of which list any portfolio holdings or balances.
