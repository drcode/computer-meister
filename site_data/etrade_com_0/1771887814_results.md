FAIL — The provided HTML snapshots do not contain the “Conrad” portfolio holdings table (symbols/quantities) or any cash balance figure.

What’s missing from the snapshots:
- A positions/holdings section showing **stock symbols and quantities** for the “Conrad” portfolio (or any visible account).
- A balances/cash section showing the **cash balance** for the “Conrad” portfolio (or any visible account).
- Evidence that a portfolio/account named **“Conrad”** exists on the shown pages.

The snapshots shown are primarily the site header/navigation (Complete View / Portfolios link) and tracking/empty frames; they do not include the actual portfolio positions or cash balance data needed to answer the query.
