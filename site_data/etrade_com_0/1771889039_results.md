- ASML — 588  
- APD — 35,000  
- NVDA — 588,360

**What’s missing for the query:**
- A **cash balance** field/value for Conrads -6012 is not present in the provided HTML. The page shows “Net Account Value” and purchasing power figures, and a “Margin Debit” line, but no explicit “Cash” / “Cash balance” amount.
