FAIL — The provided HTML snapshots do not include any portfolio/positions table or any account cash balance information.

What’s missing from the snapshots:
- Any section showing a portfolio named **“Conrad”** (no portfolio list or account selector content is present).
- Any **stock holdings/positions** data (symbols, quantities, market value, etc.). The “Portfolios Positions” page (page_4.html) only shows the site header/navigation; the positions content is not included.
- Any **cash balance** figure for the account/portfolio (no balances module/table is present).

To answer, I would need the part of the “Portfolios > Positions” page that lists holdings for the Conrad portfolio (or the primary account) and the cash line item/balance for that same account.
