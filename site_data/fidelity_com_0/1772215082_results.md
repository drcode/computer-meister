FAIL — the snapshots do not show the full “stock holdings” list for the Joint WROS portfolio in the newest page (page_25), because it is on the **Summary** tab and only shows “top and bottom movers,” not all holdings/quantities.

What is missing:
- A complete **Positions** table (all stock holdings) for **Joint WROS (X83810206)** in the newest snapshot (page_25).  
  - The full holdings list *is* visible in an older snapshot (page_24), but the instruction requires answering strictly from the provided snapshots; page_25 does not contain the full holdings list.

What I can extract from the newest snapshot (page_25):
- **Account found:** Joint WROS (Brokerage: X83810206)
- **Cash balance (using “Available to trade (all settled)”):** **$890.36**

Visible accounts (in case needed):
- Joint WROS (X83810206)
- RAISE MARKETPLACE (44546)
- WOLTERS KLUWER 401K (90415)
- Uniform Transfers to Minors (UTMA) (X85361387)
