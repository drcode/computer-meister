FAIL — The provided snapshots (pages 7–10) only show Fidelity’s general homepage/navigation, news, and cookie/privacy text. They do **not** include any “Portfolio”/“Account Positions” page content, any account named **“Joint WROS”** (or similar), any list of stock holdings (symbols/quantities), or any cash/margin balance.

Missing evidence needed:
- A snapshot showing the **Joint WROS** account/portfolio positions (symbols + quantities)
- A snapshot showing the **cash balance or margin balance** for that same account
