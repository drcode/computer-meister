FAIL — The provided snapshots do not contain any “large portfolio” account details, positions/holdings, or any cash/margin balance.

What’s missing from the snapshots:
- A Fidelity **Portfolio** or **Positions** page showing the account named “large portfolio” (or similar).
- The **list of stock holdings** for that account.
- The account’s **cash balance** and/or **margin balance**.

The snapshots shown are Fidelity public pages (news/home), logout pages, and the login page—none include portfolio holdings or balances.
