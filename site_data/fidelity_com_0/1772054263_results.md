FAIL — The provided snapshots do not contain any “Joint WROS” portfolio positions or balances.

What’s missing from the evidence:
- A Fidelity **Portfolio / Positions** page (or any account detail page) that shows the **“Joint WROS”** account.
- The **stock holdings list** for that portfolio.
- The **cash balance or margin balance** for that portfolio.

The supplied pages are Fidelity public/home content and a logout page, with no account holdings or cash/margin information shown.
