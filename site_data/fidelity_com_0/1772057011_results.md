FAIL — The provided snapshots do not show any “Joint WROS” portfolio holdings or a cash/margin balance.

What’s missing:
- No Portfolio/Positions page content listing accounts, holdings, or balances.
- The snapshots only show Fidelity public/home content and login/logged-out pages (“You are now logged out” and “Log in to Fidelity”).

Accounts/data visible in the snapshots:
- None (no account list, no “Joint WROS” account, no positions, no cash or margin figures are shown).
