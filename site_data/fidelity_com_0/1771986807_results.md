FAIL — No account named “large portfolio” (or a close match) is visible in the provided snapshots, so I can’t list holdings/cash for that specific account.

What *is* visible instead is the **Investment account “Joint WROS (Brokerage: X83810206)”**, which shows these stock holdings:
- **ALNT** (Allient Inc Com)
- **AMZN** (Amazon.com Inc)
- **BIDU** (Baidu Inc Spon ADS each rep 8 ord shs)
- **GOOGL** (Alphabet Inc Cap Stk Cl A)
- **MU** (Micron Technology Inc)
- **NVDA** (NVIDIA Corporation Com)
- **QCOM** (Qualcomm Inc)
- **TSLA** (Tesla Inc Com)

Cash/margin balance for the requested “large portfolio” account is **not shown**. (The positions list includes a “Cash — HELD IN MONEY MARKET” line, but it does not display a cash amount/balance in the snapshot.)
