FAIL — The provided snapshots only show Fidelity.com **search results for “portfolio summary”** and general site navigation/cookie text. They do **not** include any **Portfolio/Positions** page content showing an account/portfolio named **“Joint WROS”** (or similar), nor any table/list of **stock holdings (symbols + quantities)**, nor any **cash or margin balance** for that portfolio.
