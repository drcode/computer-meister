FAIL — The provided snapshots do not show the “Joint WROS” portfolio, any stock holdings, or any cash/margin balance.

What is visible in the snapshots:
- **page_5.html, page_6.html, page_7.html:** Fidelity public/home-style content (navigation menus, “Your 2025 tax forms are now available,” news/markets, cookie/privacy settings). **No account summary, no portfolio list, and no “Joint WROS” section or holdings/balances.**
- **page_8.html:** A **logout confirmation page** (“You are now logged out. Thank you for visiting.”) plus general security and cookie/privacy text. **No account information.**

What’s missing to answer the query:
- A snapshot of the **Portfolio/Account Positions** page (or account summary) that specifically shows **“Joint WROS”** with its **positions (stock holdings)** and **cash or margin balance**.
